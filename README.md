## Insights
- Recession periods significantly reduce automobile sales, with average yearly sales dropping compared to non-recession years—highlighting the sensitivity of consumer spending to economic downturns.
- Executive and sports cars experience the steepest decline during recessions, while supermini and small family cars maintain more stable sales—suggesting a shift toward affordability in tough times.
- Advertising expenditure remains high even during recessions, but its effectiveness varies by vehicle type—indicating that marketing strategies may need to be more targeted during economic slumps.
- Unemployment rate has a strong inverse correlation with automobile sales, especially for higher-end vehicle types—reinforcing the link between job security and big-ticket purchases.
- Seasonal trends persist across years, with spikes in sales during spring and fall months—suggesting that timing promotions around these periods could optimize revenue regardless of economic conditions.
